1,"DOC001_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","The optimal blast temperature range for the blast furnace is 1080-1220°C. Operating below 1080°C can lead to reduced hot metal temperature and increased fuel consumption."
2,"DOC002_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","Increasing the oxygen enrichment from 4% to 8% can improve productivity by 15% and reduce coke rate by 25 kg/thm."
3,"DOC003_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","When the silicon content in hot metal exceeds 0.8%, it indicates excessive temperature in the lower part of the furnace or reduced slag basicity."
4,"DOC004_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","The moisture in the blast should be controlled between 16-25 g/Nm³ to maintain stable operation. High moisture increases fuel rate and reduces flame temperature."
5,"DOC005_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","Pulverized coal injection rate should be maintained between 160-200 kg/thm for optimal operation. Exceeding 200 kg/thm may lead to incomplete combustion and accumulation in the raceway."
6,"DOC006_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","The optimal basicity (CaO/SiO2) ratio for sinter is 1.9-2.2. Higher basicity improves reducibility but may decrease physical strength."
7,"DOC007_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Maintaining bed height between 520-580 mm is recommended for achieving consistent sinter quality across the strand."
8,"DOC008_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Coke breeze addition in the range of 7.0-8.0% is optimal for sintering. Excessive coke leads to higher fuel consumption without quality benefits."
9,"DOC009_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","The flame front speed should be controlled between 22-28 mm/min. Faster speeds may result in incomplete sintering of the lower layers."
10,"DOC010_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Return fines ratio should be maintained below 30% to ensure consistent sinter strand permeability."
11,"DOC011_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","Top pressure should be maintained between 2.0-2.5 bar for optimal furnace performance. Higher pressure improves productivity but increases energy consumption."
12,"DOC012_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","The optimal hot metal temperature range is 1480-1520°C. Temperatures below 1480°C indicate poor thermal efficiency."
13,"DOC013_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","Coke reactivity index should be maintained between 55-65% for stable furnace operation. Higher reactivity improves combustion efficiency."
14,"DOC014_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","The optimal SiO2 content in sinter should be between 4.8-5.5%. Higher SiO2 content increases slag volume in the blast furnace."
15,"DOC015_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Al2O3 content in sinter should be kept below 2.0% to maintain good reducibility and avoid excessive slag formation."
16,"DOC016_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","MgO content in sinter should be maintained between 1.5-1.8% to ensure proper slag fluidity in the blast furnace."
17,"DOC017_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Ignition temperature should be controlled between 1090-1100°C for optimal sintering process."
18,"DOC018_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Burn-through temperature should be maintained between 1250-1270°C to ensure complete sintering and good quality."
19,"DOC019_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Moisture content in the sinter mix should be between 6.0-7.0% for optimal granulation and permeability."
20,"DOC020_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Tumbler index should be above 75% to ensure good mechanical strength of the sinter product."
21,"DOC021_Sinter_Plant_Operations.txt","Sinter Plant Operations","Reducibility index should be maintained above 65% to ensure good reduction behavior in the blast furnace."
22,"DOC022_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","The optimal sinter ratio in the burden should be between 70-75% for stable furnace operation."
23,"DOC023_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","Pellet ratio in the burden should be maintained between 15-25% to ensure proper burden distribution."
24,"DOC024_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","Fuel rate should be optimized between 440-460 kg/thm for efficient operation. Higher rates indicate poor thermal efficiency."
25,"DOC025_Blast_Furnace_Operations.txt","Blast Furnace Operations","The optimal hot metal silicon content should be between 0.4-0.6% for stable furnace operation and good quality."
